## Overview

This project investigates the structural and behavioral determinants of adolescent obesity in the United States, with a focus on **income inequality**, **healthcare access**, and **racial/ethnic disparities**. Using nationally representative data from the **National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH)** for 2019 and 2023, we estimate logistic models and compute inequality indices to explore how social determinants shape health outcomes in youth.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the impact of **socioeconomic, racial, and healthcare factors** on adolescent obesity.
- Compare **pre- and post-COVID** trends in obesity using year-fixed effects.
- Apply the **PRECEDE-PROCEED** public health framework to interpret results.
- Quantify inequality using the **Concentration Index** and **Kakwani Index** by subgroup.

## 🧪 Methodology

- 📊 **Data Source**: National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) 2019 & 2023
- 🔁 **Model**: Pooled logistic regression with marginal effects
- 📈 **Inequality Metrics**: Concentration Index (CI), Kakwani Index
- 🧠 **Framework**: PRECEDE-PROCEED model used for behavioral context
